**Facilitator approach:** Acknowledge these are legitimate concerns that many students share. The CLEAR framework addresses each of these worries.

---

### The CLEAR Framework for Ethical AI Use (20 minutes)

#### C - Credit and Cite (4 minutes)

**The Principle:** Always acknowledge when and how you used AI assistance.

**Practical Guidelines:**

**For Academic Papers:**
```
Example citation: "Initial ideas were generated using ChatGPT (OpenAI, accessed March 15, 2024) for brainstorming potential research topics. All analysis, research, and conclusions are original work based on peer-reviewed sources."
```

**For Code Projects:**
```
Example documentation: "Used ChatGPT to explain the concept of recursion and provide a basic template. All implementation, testing, and debugging completed independently."
```

**For Group Projects:**
```
Example process note: "Team used AI tools for initial brainstorming and outline creation. All research, analysis, and final recommendations developed through team discussion and independent research."
```

**What constitutes proper attribution:**
- Name of the AI tool used
- Date of access  
- Specific way AI was used (brainstorming, explanation, editing, etc.)
- Clear distinction between AI assistance and original work

#### L - Learn, Don't Substitute (3 minutes)

**The Principle:** Use AI to enhance your understanding, not replace your thinking.

**✅ Responsible Approaches:**
- **Concept explanation:** "Explain photosynthesis in simple terms"
- **Feedback on ideas:** "What are potential weaknesses in this business plan?"
- **Study assistance:** "Quiz me on database normalization concepts"  
- **Writing improvement:** "How can I make this paragraph clearer?"

**❌ Problematic Approaches:**
- **Complete assignment generation:** "Write my entire essay about climate change"
- **Blind copying:** Using AI code without understanding how it works
- **Avoiding learning:** Always asking AI instead of consulting textbooks/lectures
- **Submission without comprehension:** Handing in work you can't explain

**Red Flag Self-Check:** 
*"If AI tools disappeared tomorrow, would I be able to complete similar work based on what I've learned from using them?"*

#### E - Evaluate and Verify (3 minutes)

**The Principle:** AI can be wrong, biased, or outdated. Always verify important information.

**Verification Strategies by Content Type:**

**For Factual Claims:**
1. **Cross-reference with authoritative sources**
2. **Check publication dates** - AI training data has cutoff dates  
3. **Look for peer-reviewed research** when available
4. **Verify statistics with original sources**

**For Code Solutions:**
1. **Test thoroughly** before submission
2. **Understand each line** - be able to explain the logic
3. **Check for security vulnerabilities** or inefficiencies
4. **Validate against assignment requirements**

**For Analysis and Arguments:**
1. **Consider alternative perspectives** AI might have missed
2. **Look for logical gaps** or unsupported conclusions  
3. **Add your own critical thinking** and domain knowledge
4. **Check for potential biases** in AI responses

**Real Example of AI Error:**
*Show a screenshot where ChatGPT provides an incorrect date, statistic, or technical explanation, then demonstrate how to verify and correct it.*

*[SCREENSHOT SPACE: Example of AI providing incorrect information and the verification process]*

#### A - Avoid Academic Dishonesty (3 minutes)

**The Principle:** Understand and follow your institution's specific AI policies.

**Common Policy Categories:**

- No AI tools allowed for any part of assignment
- Often in subjects testing specific skills (writing, coding fundamentals)

**2. Restricted Use:**
- AI allowed only for specific tasks (brainstorming, grammar checking)
- Must be disclosed in assignment submission

**3. Disclosed Use:**  
- AI assistance allowed with proper attribution
- Students must explain how AI was used

**4. Encouraged Use:**
- AI promoted as learning tool
- Focus on teaching responsible integration

**Before Using AI - Always Check:**
- ✅ Course syllabus for AI policy
- ✅ Specific assignment instructions  
- ✅ When in doubt, ask your instructor
- ✅ Institution's academic integrity guidelines

**Remember:** Policies may vary by course, professor, and type of assignment.

#### R - Respect Intellectual Property (2 minutes)

**The Principle:** Be mindful of copyright and privacy considerations.

**Guidelines:**
- **Don't input confidential information** (personal data, proprietary company information)
- **Respect copyright** when using AI for content creation
- **Understand AI training sources** - AI learns from copyrighted material
- **Be cautious with sensitive data** - assume AI interactions could be stored

**Example Scenarios:**

### Interactive Case Study Analysis (5 minutes)

#### Case Study 1: The Overwhelmed Student
**Scenario:** *"Maria has three assignments due next week. She uses ChatGPT to write complete drafts for two essays and a business proposal, then submits them with minor edits. She doesn't mention AI use because the assignment instructions don't specifically prohibit it."*

**Discussion Questions:**
- What did Maria do wrong according to CLEAR framework?
- How could she have used AI more appropriately? 
- What are the learning consequences of her approach?

**Better Approach:**
- Use AI for **brainstorming and outlining**
- Get AI **feedback on her own draft ideas**
- Use AI to **explain concepts** she doesn't understand
- **Properly cite** AI assistance in her work

#### Case Study 2: The Collaborative Coder
**Scenario:** *"Alex is stuck on a programming assignment. He asks ChatGPT to explain the algorithm concept, provides his attempt at the code for feedback, and uses AI suggestions to debug his approach. He documents his process and includes a note about AI assistance with his submission."*

**Discussion Questions:**
- How does this align with ethical AI use?
- What makes this different from the first scenario?
- How does this enhance rather than replace learning?

**Why This Works:**
- AI used for **understanding, not completion**
- Student maintains **ownership of the learning process**  
- **Transparent documentation** of AI assistance
- **Original problem-solving** with AI as a guide
